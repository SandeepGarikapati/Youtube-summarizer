# Video Transcript Summarizer

## Project Overview

In today's digital age, an enormous number of video recordings are created and shared online daily. With the increasing volume of content, it becomes challenging to watch every video in its entirety, especially when the videos are longer than expected. Furthermore, manually searching for relevant information in these videos can be time-consuming and inefficient. 

The Video Transcript Summarizer project aims to address this challenge by automatically summarizing transcripts of videos. By utilizing state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for abstractive text summarization, this project will allow users to quickly identify important patterns and information within video content without the need to watch the entire video.

This project provides a hands-on opportunity to explore advanced NLP techniques and implement an innovative idea, making it suitable for intermediate practitioners and a refreshing hobby project for professionals.
